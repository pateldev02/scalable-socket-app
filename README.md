# scalable-socket-app
To build a scalable socket application with Redis pub/sub architecture and TurboRepo, you would integrate a real-time communication framework (like Node.js and Socket.io) with Redis for message handling. TurboRepo is used to manage and spin up multiple servers simultaneously, ensuring efficient scaling and deployment.
